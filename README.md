                                        by Abeeek
The code is a C++ program that defines a class prismasegitiga represents a triangular prism.
The class of code has private data members alas segitiga, tinggi segitiga, and rusuk prisma, 
which represent the base length, height, and side length of the prism, respectively. 
It also has public member functions that calculate the volume, surface area, and perimeter of the prism.

The program defines three constructors for the prismasegitiga class:

- prismasegitiga(): a default constructor that initializes the luas data member to 0.
- prismasegitiga(float alas, float tinggi): a constructor that takes the base length and height of 
the prism as parameters and calculates the area of the base triangle and assigns it to the luas data member.
- prisma segitiga(float alas): a constructor that takes the base length of the prism as a parameter and 
calculates the perimeter of the base triangle and assigns it to the keliling data member.

The program also defines a member function volumeprisma that takes the base length, height, and 
side length of the prism as parameters and calculates the volume of the prism.

In the main() function, the program creates three objects of the prisma segitiga class using 
the different constructors, and calls the member functions to calculate and display the surface area, 
perimeter, and volume of the prism.
